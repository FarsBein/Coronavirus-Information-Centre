# Coronavirus Information Centre
Me, @ManveerGill and @laithkamal were assigned to make a website for our final project. As the pandemic began, we noticed that most of the websites did not have all the information we needed about COVID-19. We often were misled or misinformed with most of the websites, that is why we wanted to create a website that was essentially a compilation of the most important information about the coronavirus, taking into account where that information was brought from because we wanted it to be from a reliable and trustworthy source. A personal goal of ours was to create something usefull with what we have learned in CPS530 web development.
