        <!-- A div to hold some basic HTML text about some FAQ regarding covid. Uses simple headers and paragraph tags -->
        <div class="faq-style">
            <h2>What is Coronavirus?</h2>
                <p>Coronavirus, or Covid-19, is a new virus that originated in China in late 2019. It is said to have originated from one of the various seafood markets in Wuhan, but the
                    exact origin is still being traced. It's symptoms are very similar to the common flu but much more intense. 
                </p>
            
            <h2>How does Coronavirus spread?</h2>
                <p>Coronavirus spread is caused by droplets being released into the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. These droplets can then be
                    transferred from person to person via touching these droplets once they land on a surface, thus spreading the infection. 
                </p>

            <h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>
                <p>See our <a href="../../pages/symptoms/symptoms.html">Symptoms page.</a></p>

            <h2>Is there a vaccine?</h2>
                <p>Currently there are no approved vaccines available. However, researchers are hard at work at developing a safe vaccine as fast as possible.</p>

            <h2>What is social distancing?</h2>
                <p>Social distancing is the name given to the concept of keeping your distance from others when you're out of your home. The idea is that you should try and 
                    remain 6 feet apart from each other at all times to reduce community spread.
                </p>

            <h2>What is community spread?</h2>
                <p>Community spread is typically defined to be when a person has been infected without necessarily knowing exactly where they contracted the virus from.</p>

            <h2>How can I protect myself?</h2>
                <p>Please refer to our <a href="../../pages/prevention/prevention.html"> page on prevention</a>, but in general you should wear a mask when you're out, regularly wash your hands and practice social distancing.</p>

            <h2>Why should I wear a mask?</h2>
                <p>An N95 mask should always be worn when leaving your house. Wearing a mask greatly reduces transmission of the virus if everyone is wearing a mask.
                    It also prevents people from spreading the virus if they're asymptomatic.
                </p>

            <h2>What does being asymptomatic mean?</h2>
                <p>Being asymptomatic means that you are carrying coronavirus without showing any symptoms. Individuals that have Covid-19 can be carrying the virus
                    for many days before showing symptoms, which can increase transmission of the virus due to a false sense of security.
                </p>

            <h2>How long will it take for symptoms to show up?</h2>
                <p>The incubation period is set as 14 days, so symptoms of coronavirus tend to show up within 14 days of being exposed to the virus.</p>

            <h2>Who is most at risk of Covid-19?</h2>
                <p>Generally, people with weaker immune systems are more prone to the dangers of Covid-19 than others. This includes the elderly and other
                    people who have compromised immune systems.
                </p>
